//! Syntax checking for the fenced code blocks in an OKF bundle.
//!
//! This crate exists because of a separation-of-concerns problem in the OKF
//! ecosystem. It was written to be given away, and has been: see
//! [Provenance](#provenance).
//!
//! # Why it is separate
//!
//! Upstream's `okf-validator` answers two different questions with one crate:
//! *"is this a conformant OKF bundle?"* — frontmatter shape, trust tiers,
//! provenance, link resolution, concept-id rules — and *"does the Python in this
//! fenced block parse?"*. The first is what an interchange format is for. The
//! second is a linter's job, and every consumer of the format checker pays the
//! supply chain of the code checker to get it: `rustpython-parser` alone is 61
//! crates, carries `LGPL-3.0-only` through the `malachite` tree, and pulls six
//! unmaintained `unic-*` advisories whose own text says no safe upgrade exists.
//!
//! That bought two of the validator's thirty-four checks. This workspace could
//! not take it — `cargo deny` refuses the tree on both licence and advisory
//! grounds, and admitting a licence merely to turn CI green is not a thing this
//! repository does.
//!
//! [`conform_okf`] therefore rebuilt the *structural* half, which is the half
//! that is about OKF, and recorded the two code-parsing checks as the only
//! intended behavioural difference from upstream over the published corpus.
//! **This crate is that difference**, and `conform-okf`'s default-off `syntax`
//! feature is where the two are joined back together.
//!
//! [`conform_okf`]: https://docs.rs/conform-okf
//!
//! # The shape: a pure-Rust core, and every parser optional
//!
//! The lesson of that failure is not "pick better parsers", it is that **a
//! consumer should choose what it is willing to compile**. So the core here
//! parses no programming language at all, and every backend — *including*
//! tree-sitter — is a feature.
//!
//! With `--no-default-features` this crate compiles no grammar and invokes no C
//! toolchain, and still does everything that needs no code parser:
//!
//! | Always available | How |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | Lifting fenced blocks out of markdown | [`extract_fenced_code_blocks`] |
//! | JSON | `serde_json` |
//! | YAML | `okf_core::yaml` — the parser that read the frontmatter |
//! | Shell quoting and bracket balance | a small matcher in this crate |
//!
//! | Feature | Adds | Costs |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `grammars` *(default)* | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Bash | tree-sitter grammars, which compile C |
//! | `sql` *(default)* | SQL, via `sqlparser` | ~17 crates, two of which compile assembly |
//!
//! That is also what makes the crate donatable. Upstream describes itself as a
//! pure-Rust implementation, so a backend that compiles C cannot be mandatory;
//! with this shape they can take the core, keep their existing parsers behind
//! their own features, and consumers who only want conformance opt out of all of
//! it. See `W4G1/okf#4`.
//!
//! # A checker that cannot check must say so
//!
//! Because backends are optional, a language can be *unsupported in this build*
//! rather than *clean*. Conflating those is how a check becomes vacuous — it
//! passes because nothing ran.
//!
//! [`check_syntax`] still returns `Ok` for a language it cannot parse, because
//! it is a drop-in for upstream's function and refusing a document over our own
//! build configuration would be wrong. But [`is_checkable`] reports the truth,
//! and callers that summarise results are expected to use it to distinguish
//! "checked, clean" from "not checked". [`checkable_languages`] gives the whole
//! set for a build.
//!
//! # The API is upstream's, deliberately
//!
//! [`Language`], [`FencedCodeBlock`], [`SyntaxError`], [`check_syntax`] and
//! [`extract_fenced_code_blocks`] mirror `okf_validator::syntax` item for item,
//! including field names and the tag-to-language mapping, so it is a drop-in and
//! can be deleted here if upstream adopts it.
//!
//! # The accuracy trade, stated honestly
//!
//! tree-sitter is an **error-tolerant** parser. It does not reject input; it
//! builds a tree and marks the parts it could not fit as `ERROR` or `MISSING`
//! nodes. That is a different instrument from a compiler front-end, and it fails
//! in a specific direction: more likely to **accept** something a strict parser
//! rejects than to reject something valid.
//!
//! For code samples in somebody else's documentation that is usually the right
//! direction — a false rejection makes the check unusable against real bundles,
//! a false acceptance merely means it did not fire — and it is what §11 asks
//! for.
//!
//! **Usually, but not always, and the exception decided the feature set.** SQL
//! is handled by `sqlparser` and *not* by a grammar, because
//! `tree-sitter-sequel` rejects **78 of 78** SQL blocks in the four bundles
//! published in the OKF specification repository: it cannot parse `BigQuery`'s
//! backtick-quoted identifiers, which is how essentially every query in that
//! corpus names its table. An error-tolerant parser is not automatically the
//! safer choice; it is only safer where its tolerance covers the dialect in
//! front of it.
//!
//! That was found by running against somebody else's bundles rather than our
//! own fixtures. The synthetic corpus in `tests/accuracy.rs` reported zero false
//! positives while the real one was at 100%, which is worth remembering before
//! trusting any accuracy number here: the cases in that file are the ones we
//! thought to write down.
//!
//! Strictness is not automatically better either, which is why `syn` is not
//! wired up even though it is clean and already in this workspace's lockfile:
//! `syn::parse_file` rejects `let x = 1;`, because a bare statement is not a
//! valid Rust *file*. Documentation is full of fragments, so there the strict
//! parser is the one that gets it wrong. `sqlparser` has the same weakness on
//! the same kind of input — six of the corpus's SQL blocks are bare `ON`
//! clauses or scalar expressions — and it is still the right choice at 6
//! failures against 78. Both measurements are in `tests/accuracy.rs`.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Ported from the Roteiro repository at commit `8817904e`, path
//! `crates/rto-okf-syntax/`, which was published to crates.io as
//! `rto-okf-syntax 0.1.1` under `MIT OR Apache-2.0` — the same terms this
//! workspace uses, by the same author, so the move carries no licence
//! question. That crate's own manifest described it as "written to be *given
//! away*" and said it "may be deleted outright if upstream adopts it";
//! `docs/findings/0003-dependency-direction.md` settles that this repository is
//! the upstream Roteiro inherits from, so it is adopted here and the copy over
//! there is deleted rather than maintained twice.
//!
//! Two things changed in the move and nothing else did: the crate is renamed,
//! and `okf-core` is pinned at `0.2.7` rather than the `0.2.6` it arrived on,
//! so this workspace holds exactly one version of the model both it and
//! `conform-okf` read.
