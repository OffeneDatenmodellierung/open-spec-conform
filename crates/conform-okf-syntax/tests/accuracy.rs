//! What this checker actually catches, measured rather than claimed.
//!
//! tree-sitter is error-tolerant: it never refuses input, it marks what it could
//! not fit. Substituting it for a compiler front-end is only defensible if the
//! substitution is *measured*, and measured in the right direction — a checker
//! that rejects valid code is unusable against third-party bundles, while one
//! that occasionally accepts nonsense has merely failed to fire.
//!
//! So this corpus is weighted toward **valid but awkward** input: the cases a
//! naive checker gets wrong by being too strict. Nested f-string format
//! specifiers, private class fields, `match` statements, `...` placeholders,
//! window functions, optional chaining. If any of these regressed to a rejection
//! the crate would be actively harmful, which is why they are pinned here.
//!
//! Every test here runs in **every** feature configuration. A case whose
//! language this build cannot check is asserted to report clean rather than
//! skipped, so a `--no-default-features` run still proves something.
//!
//! # Where these cases come from, and why that matters
//!
//! The SQL cases are lifted from the four bundles published in the OKF
//! specification repository at `ad30107`, not invented. That distinction is not
//! pedantry: an earlier version of this file contained only SQL *we* had
//! written, reported **zero** false positives, and was wrong. Against the real
//! corpus the then-default `tree-sitter-sequel` backend rejected **78 of 78**
//! blocks, because it cannot parse `BigQuery`'s backtick-quoted identifiers — and
//! that is how essentially every query in the corpus names its table.
//!
//! A corpus of cases you thought to write down measures what you already
//! suspected. Where a real one exists, use it.
